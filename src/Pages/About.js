        I would not challenge a giant. I'm afraid of the world. If you want it,
        boys, get it here. Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever. Come out of
        the garden, baby, you'll catch your death in the fog. Wake up in the
        wrong town, boy you really get around. Listen. It's a very modern world,
        but nobody's perfect. I watch the ripples change their size, but never
        leave the stream. I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back.{" "}

        I'm floating in a most peculiar way. I found my teacher crouching in his
        overalls. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? He'll
        think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing
        to do. Strange fascination, fascinating me. The far side of town, where
        the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground.
        Somewhere, someone's calling me when the chips are down. Last night they
        loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. What you like is in
        the limo. Yes we're lovers, and that is that.{" "}

        back, walk tall, act fine. It's War-hol, actually. The return of the
        Thin White Duke. Listen. I never thought I'd need so many people. Tell
        my wife I love her very much. I've never done bad things. Oh no, don't
        say it's true.{" "}
